 A simple blackjack game made in Java.

 :information_source: Blackjack is a card game where players aim to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. Each player is dealt two cards, trying to reach 21 or get as close as possible without busting. The dealer follows specific rules when playing their hand. The one closest to 21 without going over wins. If the player or dealer gets a total of 21 with their first two cards (a blackjack), they win instantly.
