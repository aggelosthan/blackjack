:information_source: Blackjack is a card game where players aim to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21. Each player is dealt two cards, trying to reach 21 or get as close as possible without busting. The dealer follows specific rules when playing their hand. The one closest to 21 without going over wins. If the player or dealer gets a total of 21 with their first two cards (a blackjack), they win instantly.
:information_source:Blackjack is a card game where players aim to beat the dealer's hand without exceeding 21 points. Each player is dealt two cards initially. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points, numbered cards retain their face value, and Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points.
:information_source:Players have the option to "hit" (receive another card) to improve their hand or "stand" (keep their current hand). Additionally, players may have the option to "double down" (double their initial bet for one more card) or "split" (if dealt a pair).
:information_source:The dealer follows specific rules: typically, they must hit until their hand totals 17 or higher. However, this may vary based on the casino, with some requiring the dealer to hit on a soft 17 (an Ace and a 6).
:information_source:A "Blackjack" occurs when a player or dealer gets an Ace and a 10-value card with their initial two cards. Getting a Blackjack typically results in an instant win, unless both the player and dealer have Blackjack, resulting in a push (tie).
